                <img class="image" src="assets/images/Screen Shot 2018-06-16 at 10.23.23 PM.png" alt="Profile Picture"> I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I lived in Denton while attending University of North Texas wehre I
                studied Biology and Chemistry for my undergraduate degree. After getting my Bachelors Degree I moved back
                to Dallas and began working in logistics for a ground transportation company. After working in that industry
                for five years I decided to go back to school to pursue an MBA and attended University of Texas at Dallas'
                full-time MBA program. After graduation I began working as an IT Project Manager focusing in software development
                and just celebrated my one year anniversary in June of 2018.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My hobbies include playing video games, reading sci-fi novels, going to local art galleries and museums, and cramming my
                brain full of seemingly trivial factoids.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I love to travel and my wife and I try and get out of town whenever we have the chance. In the past year we have been fortunate
                enough to go to New York , Seattle, Portland, Hawaii, the Dominican Republic, Japan and Hong Kong and we
                are currently planning our next big adventure for 2019.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am super excited to be going through this bootcamp and looking forward to all of the awesome things we will
                learn throughout the program.</p>
